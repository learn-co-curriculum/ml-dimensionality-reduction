Additionally, it is just not very useful to have highly correlated in your model as predictors when they are highly correlated. Let's have another glance at the remaining data."

    "At first glance, having 29 categories (28 and some unknowns, given by 0) does not seem like a dimensionality issue per se, as it is still contained in one variable. But remember that for many problems, each one of these classes will be transformed in its own column of dummy variables. So essentially, we would end op with 29-1 additional columns here. We have a fairly small data set, so it just doesn't seem appropriate to keep all 29 categories. A popular strategy that is being used is by grouping certain variables together. Before we decide *how* we will do this, let's have a look at the data by looking at the value counts."
